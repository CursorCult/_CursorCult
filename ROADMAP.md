# CursorCult Roadmap

CursorCult is meant to grow as a library of small, opinionated Cursor rules.

Near term:

- Add more rule packs and cross‑links between related rules.
- Standardize tags/topics for easier discovery.
- Optionally add an org‑wide template repo for new rule packs.

Longer term:

- Curate “starter sets” of rules for popular stacks and workflows.
